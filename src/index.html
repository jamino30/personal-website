            <p>I'm Jai, currently in my third year as a Computer Science and AI student at Northeastern University in Boston, MA. I am a software engineer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where my focus is bringing ML approaches to its Dandi Search Engine.</p>
            <p>One of my current projects is the development of Verdant, a project that serves as a versatile playground and library for evaluating and sharing Large Language Models (LLMs).            </p>
            <p>I'm deeply engaged in research related to large language models and NLP. Additionally, I find the applications of computer vision and the world of autonomous vehicles quite fascinating.</p>

            <h3>Natural Language Processing</h3>
            <p> NLP is a fascinating field where machines are trained to understand and generate human language. 
                What makes it truly exciting is the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs). 
                Popular models like <a href="https://openai.com/research/gpt-4" target="_blank">GPT-4</a> and <a href="https://ai.meta.com/llama/" target="_blank">LLaMa</a> have brought unprecedented capabilities to NLP. 
                They can perform tasks like text generation, translation, and even answer questions with remarkable fluency.</p>
            <p> As a software engineer at MIT, I am working on improving Dandi search engine, utilizing LLMs for a transformative impact.
                LLMs enable not only better search results but also the potential to extract valuable insights from a vast repository of data.</p>
            <p> LLMs have the potential to revolutionize how we access and understand this complex data, making work at the intersection of NLP and LLMs incredibly exciting and influential.
